The "Bookso" project is an online platform that combines modern web technologies with artificial intelligence capabilities to streamline the process of creating ebooks. The project's goal is to provide users with an intuitive tool for generating, editing, and managing electronic book content, utilizing the potential of artificial intelligence to support the creative process.

1.1. Project Objective

The main objective of EbookMaker is to enable users to:
• Quickly create ebook structure (chapters and subchapters) using AI
• Generate initial content for each chapter through integration with OpenAI API
• Have the ability to regenerate content if the originally created content is unsatisfactory
• Export the finished ebook to PDF format

The project aims not only to facilitate the ebook creation process but also to demonstrate the practical application of advanced web technologies and artificial intelligence in a real-world user scenario.

1.2. Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the implementation of the Bookso project:
• Django: A high-level Python framework for creating web applications, which served as the backend foundation for the project.
• OpenAI API: A programming interface enabling integration of advanced language models for content generation.
• fpdf2: A Python library for creating PDF files, used for exporting finished ebooks.
• HTML/TAILWINDCSS/JavaScript: Frontend technologies used to create an interactive and responsive user interface.
• SQLite: A lightweight database used to store information about users, projects, and ebook content.
• Git and GitHub: Version control and source code hosting tools, facilitating project management and change tracking.
